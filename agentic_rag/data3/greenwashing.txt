Greenwashing: The Illusion of Sustainability

Greenwashing refers to the practice of falsely portraying products, policies, or organizations as environmentally friendly to mislead consumers or investors. It undermines genuine sustainability efforts and erodes public trust in corporate responsibility.

Companies engage in greenwashing through vague claims (“eco-friendly,” “natural”), selective reporting, or symbolic gestures that distract from harmful practices. For instance, a company may highlight recyclable packaging while concealing its high carbon emissions or unethical labor practices. Greenwashing can also occur when firms spend more on marketing their sustainability than on actually implementing it.

Regulatory bodies and watchdog organizations are tightening scrutiny to combat greenwashing. The European Union and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) have introduced guidelines for truthful environmental advertising. In India, the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) has issued norms to ensure authenticity in green claims.

Transparency, third-party audits, and standardized ESG disclosures are essential to combat greenwashing. Genuine sustainability lies not in slogans but in measurable impact — reducing waste, conserving energy, and treating communities ethically. As public awareness grows, companies must move from “green talk” to “green action” or risk losing credibility in an increasingly conscious marketplace.
