The breakthrough moment for deep learning came in the early 2010s with the success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in computer vision. Architectures like AlexNet and ResNet achieved unprecedented accuracy in image classification tasks. Similarly, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models enabled advancements in speech recognition and sequential data processi
