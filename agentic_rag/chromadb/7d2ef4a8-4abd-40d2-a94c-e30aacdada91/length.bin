Despite immense progress, deep learning faces challenges: interpretability, data dependency, and energy consumption. The “black-box” nature of neural networks limits explainability, while training large models requires substantial hardware resources. Emerging fields like neurosymbolic AI, efficient architectures (e.g., MobileNet, DistilBERT), and federated learning are addressing these issues.
